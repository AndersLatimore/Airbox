<h1>Airbox</h1>
<h2>Lightweight, airy jQuery lightbox.</h2>
<p>Airbox is a simple, easy to use lightbox that can be used on all types of images that 
you can possibly want to use on the web.</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>You can download the lightbox here from Github at <a href="https://github.com/AndyAkesson/airbox">this</a> location.</p>
<p>Include the Airbox script and stylesheet in your project to use the Airbox lightbox.
You can then use the lightbox by setting a <code>data-airbox</code> attribute on the image-links. Make sure the <code>data-attribute</code> is set on the <code>a href</code> and not the <code>img</code> otherwise the image will be undefined. Also, make sure that you include both the javascript file and the css file in your project. Choose the minified versions if you are in need of an even lighter solution.</p>
<p><strong>You will need <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> to use this lightbox.</strong></p>
