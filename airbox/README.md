<h1>Airbox</h1>
<h2>Lightweight, airy jQuery lightbox.</h2>
<p>Airbox is a simple, easy to use lightbox that can be used on all types of images that 
you can possibly want to use on the web.</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>You can download the lightbox here from Github at <a href="https://github.com/AndyAkesson/airbox">this</a> location.
You can then use the lightbox by setting a <code>data-airbox</code> attribute on the image-links and setting the <code>div</code> to a class of <code>ab-page</code>. You can also set the <code>body</code> to a class of <code>ab-page</code>. Make sure the <code>data-attribute</code> is set on the <code>a href</code> and not the <code>img</code> otherwise the image will be undefined. Also, make sure that you include both the javascript file and the css file in your project. Choose the minified versions if you are in need of an even lighter solution.</p>
<p><strong>You will need <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery to use this lightbox.</strong></p>
